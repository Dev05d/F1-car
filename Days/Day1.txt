Today is the first day of the project - 11/12/25. 

My goal for today: Attach and run 2 motors from an esp 32.

I will use a Breadboard, Esp 32, 2 stepper motors, Motor driver, joystick and a DC output power machine as power.
Parts:
    ESP 32
    L298N motor driver
    2 stepper motors 
    A joystick.

The Code I used to test the joystick in under the Code/Stage 1 Folder in Joystick_Test.ino. It had the code to move the motor as well.
Currently The motor moves but only in one direction, so I don't think the code working. Neither do I see the Joystick positions 
in the terminal of the Arduion IDE. I have the joystick and the motor driver wired to the ESP 32 and for now only 1 motor. 

Probelems to fix for Day 2:
    Make live stats appear on Arduino IDE terminal. 
    Control motor direction with Joystick Y axis.
